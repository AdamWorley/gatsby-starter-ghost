                    <h2>Hi, I'm Lauren the owner of Crawley Dog Walkers.</h2>
                    <p>
                    I am offering a dog walking and pet sitting service in Crawley and
                    the surrounding areas. I am a caring and passionate person and
                    would like to think that this is reflected in the high level of
                    service that I offer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I created this service because I am passionate about animals
                    (especially dogs!) and would like to help owners make a positive
                    impact on their pet's happiness, health and exercise needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    I offer please have a look around my website or check out my

                    <p>
                        We provide an excellent dog walking service Monday to Saturday with
                        flexible options to suit you and your dog(s).

                        You can choose either a Solo walk, for those dogs that may not get
                        on well with others, or group walks with up to 4 dogs at a time, you
                        can also choose if you would like 40 minutes or an hour session.
                    </p>
                    <p>Additional dogs can be added at a discount from just Â£5.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>

                    <p>
                        If you're going to be away and would like for your pets to be looked
                        after in the comfort of your own home then we're here to help.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We know it can be a struggle for both owner and pet and that kennels
                        and catteries can be a daunting choice for your pets and so we
                        strive to keep them safe and comfortable in the safety of their own
                        home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The pets we are trained to look after range from cats and dogs, to
                        reptiles and amphibians and most things in between (no alligators
                        please).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another benefit is peace of mind of your own property, we will
                        ensure that it is locked and secured at all times and that curtains
                        are opened/closed and there's a general presence in the property
                        while you're away.
                    </p>
