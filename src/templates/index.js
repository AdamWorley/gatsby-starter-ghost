                    <p>
                        If you're going to be away and would like for your pets to be looked
                        after in the comfort of your own home then we're here to help.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We know it can be a struggle for both owner and pet and that kennels
                        and catteries can be a daunting choice for your pets and so we
                        strive to keep them safe and comfortable in the safety of their own
                        home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The pets we are trained to look after range from cats and dogs, to
                        reptiles and amphibians and most things in between (no alligators
                        please).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another benefit is peace of mind of your own property, we will
                        ensure that it is locked and secured at all times and that curtains
                        are opened/closed and there's a general presence in the property
                        while you're away.
                    </p>
